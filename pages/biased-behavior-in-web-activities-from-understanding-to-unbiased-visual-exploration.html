<p>Current trends in Web content point towards personalization of content, which would not be a problem in an uniform, unbiased world, but our world is neither uniform nor unbiased.
Users are not from uniform contexts, and that they do not behave equally when presented the same information nor the same user interface. 
In this dissertation, we hypothesize that systemic and cognitive biases that affect users in the physical world also affect them when exploring content on the Web.
We propose that biased behavior can be encouraged to be diminished through a holistic view that includes bias quantification, algorithmic formulation, and user interface design. Those three parts of our proposed process are implemented used Web Mining techniques, guided by Social Science views, and presented to users in Casual Information Visualization systems.
In particular, we follow a transversal approach where apply this process, with different profundity levels, in specific case studies on Wikipedia and Twitter.</p>
<p>The dissertation is organized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1 - We introduce the problem we are going to work with, our research questions, motivations and methodology.</li>
<li>Chapter 2 - Background with the State of the Art and necessary concepts to understand the dissertation.</li>
<li>Chapter 3 - A case study about <em>gender bias in Wikipedia</em>. We measure how gender bias affects characterization of women and men in their biographies in terms of meta-data, language and network structure. We found more similarities than differences, however, the differences found are important. We contextualize those differences through an analysis based in gender theory that explains the reasons behind gender bias in Wikipedia. We propose design implications for Wikipedia based on the results.</li>
<li>Chapter 4 - A case study about <em>political centralization in Twitter</em>. We study whether the population of a highly centralized country behaves in a centralized way in the micro-blogging platform. We confirm the effects of the systemic bias in user information sharing behavior, content-classification algorithms, and user perception. To counter those effects, we propose a diversity-based information filtering algorithm as well as a visualization-based user interface to display non-centralized timelines. As result, our mixed design allows users to see the diversity inherent in non-centralized timelines.</li>
<li>Chapter 5 - A case study about <em>political homophily in Twitter</em>. We study whether the discussion around a highly polarized political issue tends to divide people, and whether people involved in such discussion behave in an homophilic way. We find they do, and, in an iterative method, we design content-based recommendation algorithms and visualization-based user interfaces to encourage people to connect with others of opposing views. We do so by engaging users into exploration of non-political content through <em>data portraits</em> of themselves. We find that users engage positively with such portraits, and that injecting recommendations of people with opposing views into them helps users to explore  recommendations more than without considering visualization techniques. However, homophilic behavior still prevails, even in the presence of engaging user interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in Chapter 6, we analyze our global results. We observe that biases from the physical world are indeed reflected on Web platforms, and this reflection affects content, perception and behavior of users.
From this observation, and through the cross-sectional analysis of the case studies, we conclude:</p>
<ol>
<li>That Web Mining tools are effective to measure and detect biased behavior.</li>
<li>That Information Visualization techniques aimed at non-experts encourages unbiased exploration of content.</li>
<li>That one size does not fit all, and that in addition to the social, behavioral, and cultural contexts, biases should be accounted for when designing systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be able to reach these conclusions, we implemented systems "in the wild" where we quantitatively evaluated interaction data of end-users with those systems, focusing on user engagement metrics. The usage of these metrics is a novel contribution, as they proved to be effective when measuring differences in user behavior on exploratory contexts.</p>
